# FirstFlaskApp
This is my first attempt at creating a Flask app.

# Things learnt:
1) Creating and starting a virtual environment
Creation:
    python -m venv .venv
Initializing:
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    (The first command can be set for not only process but also CurrentUser, etc)

2) Jinja2 
Jinja2 is used for template inheritance
